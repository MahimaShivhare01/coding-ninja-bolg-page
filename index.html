            <h1 >Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
            <p>Just like with any other activity ,the world of coding is also governed by informal rule .Most of these rules are over decades .Programming languages oftesn remain in usages for longer than founders expect.</p>
            <p>Programing finds innovation ways to recreate these languages for diferant pourpose .Thus some static do and donot are always of use in the flude join called coding a normal code and greaet code hase three normal feature :maintainability ,depending and usability and .It should also be adaptable enough to be efficent even in changing enviroment .However ,before coding even begins ,a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
            <p>This is easliy the most important srep of all .In absence of these .a code may be inefficient even if it is completed.The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code cover matters like design and architecture .An important quetion is how devlopment is stuructured .What is the specific purpose of the software?The problem that the code is meant to solve must to be clear to the devloper.What is the design of the individual components?Such basic requirment have to be fulfilled when a good code is begin written.  

            </p>
            <p>once these  are meet it become easier to follow some established good coding practices.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>COMMENTING</h4>
                    <p>Commenting is one such practies that is often ignored by programmers especially for code that are written by multipe programmer on why it was a description on way it was modified on why a decription on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>GOOD NAMEING CONVENTIONS</h4>
                    <p>Using good naming convertion is the next stept to good coding . </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>DEPLOYMENT</h4>
                    <p>One the codehas been written. it has to be deployed .The installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated regulary.</p>
                    <p>The best prcties for coding are,most of all ,designd to reduce risk there are chances of it .for a beginner ,a few of these will not be completely application .But as hard as a boiiled programing codes,all these guidelines will come in handy .since code can run up to millions of lines at times at a times.</p>
